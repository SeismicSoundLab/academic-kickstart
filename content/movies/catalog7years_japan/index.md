This movie shows earthquakes from Japan larger than Magnitude 3.5 (more than 10,000 events), in the years between Jan. 1, 2008 - Dec. 31, 2014. The Magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake was on March 11, 2011 (note the title bar in the movie says 2012, which is incorrect!). This is the same time window and distance in latitude (but not longitude) as the movie on the Caribbean and Haiti M7.0 earthquake: Haiti: [vimeo.com/153547570](https://vimeo.com/153547570). The dot size is (non-linearly) proportional to magnitude and the color is proportional to depth according to these rules:\

The sound is generated by adding to the sound track tiny earthquake sounds, as described by that link.\
The data comes from the ANSS catalog of the US Geological Survey, accessible from here: [quake.geo.berkeley.edu/anss/catalog-search.html](http://www.quake.geo.berkeley.edu/anss/catalog-search.html)
