This movie shows earthquakes from California larger than Magnitude 2, in the years between 2001-2007. The Magnitude 6.2 San Simeon and Magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquakes are clear, along with their many aftershocks. The dot size is (non-linearly) proportional to magnitude and the color is proportional to depth according to these rules:\

The sound is generated by adding to the sound track tiny earthquake sounds, as described by that link.\
The data comes from the ANSS catalog of the US Geological Survey, accessible from here: [quake.geo.berkeley.edu/anss/catalog-search.html](http://quake.geo.berkeley.edu/anss/catalog-search.html)
