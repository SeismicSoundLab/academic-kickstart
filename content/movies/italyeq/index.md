This is the sonorous recording of the first one shake of the Friuli's earthquake (north Italy). A Tricesimo's boy, Mario Garlatti, was pouring again a passage of the Pink Floyd from the turntable to the cassettes recorder. The microphone, remained on, it has recorded a dramatic sequence: the arm of the turntable that jumps, the noise provoked by the shake and the terror in the house.
