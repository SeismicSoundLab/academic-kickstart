We develop methods for translating data into sound and animations, to make movies about processes that are beyond our range of direct perception. Though we started with earthquakes, the lab activities have expanded well beyond "seismic" and "sound", but the name remains. In this site, we assemble a subset of movies we have made, and some "learning units": movies assembled into short narratives to illustrate and provoke questions. In the near future, it will also have code examples to help teach our methods. For more info, see the companion site at [seismicsoundlab.org](http://www.seismicsoundlab.org/), with info on our SeismoDome program at the Hayden Planetarium in NYC. And for even more, see our first site, “[Sounds of Seismology](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/sounds-of-seismology/)“.

The lab is based at [LDEO](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) and the [Computer Music Center](https://cmc.music.columbia.edu/). Run by [Ben Holtzman](https://benholtzman.github.io), [Anna Barth](https://barthac.github.io/), and [Eric Beaucé](https://ebeauce.github.io), an incomplete list of collaborators includes [Jason Candler](https://www.guarsh.com/), [Douglas Repetto](http://douglasrepetto.com), [Arthur Pate](https://parthurp.github.io/homepage/index.html), [Leif Karlstrom](https://pages.uoregon.edu/leif/) (and the [Volcano Listening Project](http://www.volcanolisteningproject.org/)), [Martin Pratt](https://martinjpratt.wordpress.com/), [Matt Turk](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewturk/), [Lapo Boschi](http://geo.geoscienze.unipd.it/users/boschi-lapo), [Josh Russell](https://jbrussell.github.io/), [Seth Cluett](https://sethcluett.com/), [Joachim Gossmann](http://musicweb2.ucsd.edu/~jo/#intro), [Vivian Trakinski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivian-trakinski-8023062/), and many more!
