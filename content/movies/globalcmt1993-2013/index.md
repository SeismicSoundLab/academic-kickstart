This movie shows all events recorded in the Global CMT catalog from 1993 to 2013 of magnitude 5.4 and above. The time scale is 10 seconds per year.

Earthquake magnitude and location are displayed by a circle and simultaneous audio event. The circle diameter is exponentially mapped to magnitude. The audio events are synthesized to scale continuously with earthquake magnitude in pitch, decay-time and overtone content.

Please watch in HD and with stereo speakers/headphones if possible.
