The solar insolation is a measure of how much of the sun's energy hits the Earth's surface. It varies through time because of changes in the Earth's orbit. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other atmospheric gases vary in time as well, basically coupled through many complex processes in the oceans, atmosphere and biosphere. Here's CO2 data and insolation data for the last 800,000 years:

As you can see and hear, something ridiculous happens right there at the end. 
Humans figured out how to extract carbon in various forms and burn it. Energy density increases, and so does human usage. 

[include plot of various sources of human emissions of CO2.] 
 
We zoom in to the last 270 years:

The difference between human emissions and atmospheric CO2 reflects how much the oceans and biosphere can absorb, called a buffer. We are diminishing that capacity. 

And you can see the average temperature rising as well. 

Feedbacks will emerge.. And changes in weather.. Hurricanes are on the edge of that interface between weather and climate.

[put in a graph showing number and intensity of hurricanes in the last 20 years, and some predictions.]
